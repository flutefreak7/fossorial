# FOSSorial
Free Open Source Software that lives primarily underground

I learned the word "fossorial" which refers to burrowing animals that live primarily underground and realized it was the perfect name for "underground" free open source software. I have no idea what I'm going to do with this repo, but the name was too good to pass up. :)
